Project Description

The Problem We are Trying to Solve:

With the ever-expanding gamut of dietary restrictions that some have and COVID-19 keeping more people homebound, home cooking has become an essential skill.  We are hoping to create an application that can inspire and facilitate our users in becoming better home chefs.  People with limited home cooking experience may be overwhelmed by the abundance of recipes available online, and may struggle in selecting one to prepare.  We hope to design our application such that a user may find recipes tailored to a particular set of ingredients (the ingredients that the user already has at home).  This would limit the amount of searching that a user would have to do to find their ideal recipe, and would ensure that they are only looking at recipes which they have the means to prepare.
Furthermore, again due to COVID-19 keeping many at home, many people are living increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and thus, proper nutrition is vital to ensure optimal health.  We hope to design our application such that a user may find recipes according to their dietary needs or restrictions.  Our chosen API (Spoonacular) allows users to search with parameters that define minimum/maximum calories, grams of protein, grams of fat, etc.  This would allow users to spend less time searching for meals that they can eat, and more time searching for meals that they want to eat.

Our Users:

	General User: A general user who does not know what dish to prepare could use the application to discover new recipes based on the ingredients that they have at home.  They could also search for recipes based on their dietary needs, specifying attributes such as the maximum number of calories or the minimum number of grams of protein, to help them eat healthier.  Furthermore, they could find a wine pairing that suits a given recipe for a more cohesive meal.

	Administrator: An administrator for the website would have access to and manage the database of user accounts.  They would also have the privilege of being able to curate and publish site-wide lists of popular recipes and recipes of the day.

Our Strategy:

Our application will seek to help people at home find new and exciting recipes for a range of dietary needs or ingredients.  Our application features will be easily discoverable and will make it easy for users to save their favorite recipes.
The application will allow all users to search for recipes according to a set of ingredients or nutritional requirements.  In addition, all users will be able to obtain a random recipe from the application without inputting any ingredients or nutritional requirements.  We will likely offer the user two options when searching, “Search by Ingredients” or “Search by Dietary Needs”, and the application will present the user with input fields for specified ingredients or nutritional requirements according to the search option that was selected.  All users will also be able to save recipes to their account, such that they may access them later.  Furthermore, all users will be able to obtain a suitable wine pairing for a provided meal.
Administrators will have access to all of the features and options that general users have, with the addition of certain administrator-only features.  These features will likely include the ability to publish lists of recipes or a particular recipe to the home page of the application (“Recipe of the Day”).  In addition, administrators would have access to general user accounts and would be able to retrieve their saved recipes and account details.

API: Spoonacular: https://spoonacular.com/food-api

Spoonacular is an API that allows users to search for recipes according to the ingredients included in the recipe or the nutritional contents of the dish.  In addition, users may obtain random recipes or suitable wine pairings for a given dish.  Returned recipes also include pictures, allowing users to see if the dish looks appealing before preparing it.
